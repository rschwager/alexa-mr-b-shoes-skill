Hannah's Science Project
==========================

An Alexa skill to demonstrate how to build a skill.  The skill's purpose was to share sneaker info for a teacher at a local elementary school.  This teacher, Mr. B, is a sneaker head and had many pairs of sneakers that the kids enjoyed seeing and began to note.  The data is only for the 2017-18 school year.
